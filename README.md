# TypeScript Partial Demo

This demo is try to implement the [C# Partial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods) feature in TypeScript.

The goal is to find a way to extend an existing class and add methods to it, and still having the TypeScript types for the new methods.

The existing class could be in another file or even other module.


## Test

```
yarn install
yarn test
```
